# bandcamp-stream-helper

This is a tool for streamers who want to play Bandcamp music during their streams. 

## Installation

You will need at least Python 3.6.3 to run the program. In addition, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

* [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
* [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html) (as well as the respective drive for Firefox or Chrome)
* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)
* [python-vlc](https://pypi.org/project/python-vlc/)

Make sure the drive is located in the same directory you wish to run the program.

## Usage

To run the program, just type `python bc_streamer.py` in the command line. The default behavior of the program is to stream the best-selling albums for this week. There are many parameters to customize your listening experience:

* `-g`. Genre filter. Default is 'all'. A list of genres may be found in `consts.py`.
* `-s`. Sort order. Default is best-selling. A list of sort orders may be found in `consts.py`.
* `-p`. Page number. Default is 0. The page number will automatically increment as needed.
* `-gn`.[GeoName](http://www.geonames.org/) tag filter. Default is 0. Ex. Philadelphia is 4560349.
* `-f`. Format filter. Default is 'any_format'. A list of formats may be found in `consts.py`.
* `-w`. Time filter. Default is 'this_week'. A list of time filters may be found in `consts.py`.

In addition, there are some other options if you wish to have more control over which songs play:

* `--bookmark [bookmarks HTML file]`. If you have Bandcamp albums in your browser's bookmarks, you can play them from the HTML file generated by your browser when you export your bookmarks.
* `--file [txt.file]`. If you have a text file containing a newline-separated list of Bandcamp album links, you can play that using this option.
* `--shuffle`. Shuffles the order of the played albums if one of the previous two options are selected.
* `--skiplong`. Skips songs longer than `--maxlen`. Default behavior is to truncate songs to `--maxlen`.
* `--maxlen`. Maximum length for songs (in seconds) before truncation/skipping. Default is 360 seconds (6 minutes).
